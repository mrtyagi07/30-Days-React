-------------------------------Exercises: What is React?---------------------------------------------------------

1. What is React?
   React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta and a community of individual developers and companies.

2. What is a library?
   A programming library is a collection of prewritten code that programmers can use to optimize tasks. This collection of reusable code is usually targeted for specific common problems. A library usually includes a few different pre-coded components.

3. What is a single page application?
   An SPA (Single-page application) is a web app implementation that loads only a single web document, and then updates the body content of that single document via JavaScript APIs such as XMLHttpRequest and Fetch when different content is to be shown.
   This therefore allows users to use websites without loading whole new pages from the server, which can result in performance gains and a more dynamic experience, with some tradeoff disadvantages such as SEO, more effort required to maintain state, implement navigation, and do meaningful performance monitoring.

4. What is component?
   Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. Components come in two types, Class components and Function components

5. What is the latest version of React?
   18.2.0

6. What is DOM?
   The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.

7. What is React Virtual DOM?
   When anything new is added to the application, a virtual DOM is created and it is represented as a tree. Each element in the application is a node in this tree. So, whenever there is a change in the state of any element, a new Virtual DOM tree is created. This new Virtual DOM tree is then compared with the previous Virtual DOM tree and make a note of the changes. After this, it finds the best possible ways to make these changes to the real DOM. Now only the updated elements will get rendered on the page again.

8. What does a web application or a website(composed of) have?
   Web application needs authentication. The web application uses a combination of server-side scripts and client-side scripts to present information. It requires a server to manage requests from the users.
   Example: Google Apps, Amazon, YouTube
   A website provides visual and text content that users can view and read.
   To view a website requires a browser(Chrome, Firefox). There are many types of websites like Archive website, Blog, Community website, etc.

---------------------------------Exercises: JSX-----------------------------------------------

1. What is JSX?
   JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods. JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
   Example: const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;
   const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
   root.render(myElement);

2. What is babel?
   Babel is a free and open-source JavaScript transcompiler that is mainly used to convert ECMAScript 2015+ code into backwards-compatible JavaScript code that can be run by older JavaScript engines. It allows web developers to take advantage of the newest features of the language.(Convert JSX to HTML)

3. What is a transpiler?
   A source-to-source translator, source-to-source compiler, transcompiler, or transpiler is a type of translator that takes the source code of a program written in a programming language as its input and produces an equivalent source code in the same or a different programming language.
   Languages you write that transpile to JavaScript are often called compile-to-JS languages, and are said to target JavaScript. They read CoffeeScript, TypeScript, and ES2015, and spit out JavaScript guaranteed to work anywhere.
